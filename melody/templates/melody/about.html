	<h1>About Komposair</h1>
	<p>Hi, my name is Juan Carlos Pi√±eros, <a href="https://twitter.com/juancopi81">@juancopi81</a> and <strong>this is Komposair</strong>. In 2020 I took on EDX the amazing class CS50&#39;s <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/course/">Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</a> by HarvardX, taught by the excellent Professors Brian Yu <a href="https://twitter.com/brianyu28">@brianyu28</a> and David Malan <a href="https://twitter.com/davidjmalan">@davidjmalan</a>.</p>
	<p>At the end of the class we needed to submit a project using what we learnt, and this is how Komposair was born.</p>
	<p>I do not have much experience in programming so Komposair has a lot of room for improvement (also English is not my mother tongue so please forgive any typo). If you find any bug, I would appreciate if you could inform me by <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">sending me an email</a>. </p>
	<p>At Komposair I wanted to tackle a topic that I am passionate about: How artificial intelligence can help us in creative processes. For this reason, I wanted to do a project in which musicians could use AI to create melodies based on their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(music)">motifs</a>. Komposar is also a repository of melodies generated by many people using AI </p>
	<p>I have been also taking some online courses of <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">Deeplearning.ai</a> that have made a huge impact in me. Online learnings is one of the greatest things we humans have created in recent years. Please visit the <a href="{% url 'acknowledgements' %}">Acknowledgements page</a> to check all the resource that helped me create Komposair.</p>
	<p>This is the first draft of Komposair, now that I have this skeleton, my idea is to work on different models to generate better melodies. I would like to add also other options, such as more time signature, genres, duration of the result melodies, among others. I also think that working on the UX of Komposair is paramount.</p>
